- Emacs has a built-in mode for this, that's how I learned about this
  language...
- The type for anything is `mixed`
- All variables are initialized to 0, even strings...
- Therefore, `return;` returns 0
- The syntax for array and map literals is truly bizarre
- Most surprisingly, it passes all tests
