- I might regret this because Vala is effectively unsupported or something
- https://valadoc.org/ is a neat reference, wish more languages had
  such a thing
- Unfortunately the reference manual is a draft and doesn't look
  nearly as good as the tutorial
- Why only is Gee not a part of the standard bundle? It's 2017, you
  should have learned by now that having collections in language isn't
  optional...
- This might be the best language for using the GNOME libraries
- Some things seem to be plain broken, like converting an Array to an
  ArrayList (which errors out)
- `var` is neat to have and reduces the amount of type declarations,
  however it doesn't work for class fields...
- There aren't really generics
- It's encouraged to create functions with slightly different names
  accepting the respective input type as there's no argument type
  overloading
- Closures work, although you have to go through the trouble of
  creating a matching delegate type first
- Error handling is weird and only allows passing a string
- The compiler generates lots of useless warnings
