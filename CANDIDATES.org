** Languages to implement MAL in [14/105]

*** DONE Emacs Lisp

That was pretty fun and educational.

*** DONE ChucK

A nice audio programming language, with a focus on time.  Incidentally
it appears to have everything needed for implementing MAL in it...

This is harder than expected as it's neither C++ nor Java and not many
people seem to have explored the (buggy) non-audio parts.

*** DONE Common Lisp

A serious omission, given the existence of two Scheme (Racket, Guile)
and a Clojure/ClojureScript implementation.

edit: Done by one of my blog readers...

*** DONE Powershell

Open-source and running on Linux now!

Considering that the original author of MAL did implement it in Bash,
Powershell should be a piece of cake.

Done by said author.

*** DONE Picolisp

Alex Burger is a pretty cool guy, so let's see how usable his creation
is...

*** DONE Smalltalk

The other alternative to Emacs...  It inspired Ruby.

https://github.com/dubek/mal/tree/smalltalk/smalltalk

*** DONE TypeScript

JavaScript with an actually useful type system.  Makes for better
tooling?

Done by someone else.

*** DONE Elm

Purely functional frontend dev with its own take on MVC.  Can be run
from CLI and supports interop with JS, so it should be possible...

Done by another curious person with higher pain tolerance than me.

*** DONE REXX

Looks like a Tcl/Smalltalk predecessor...

Done by dubek.

*** DONE Portable R7RS Scheme

This should support all the required things (jiffies, command
arguments, file IO, modules, etc.), for regex one can vendor irregex
or just hand-roll a tokenizer.

Done by me.

*** DONE F#

Microsoft has open-sourced tons of things, so that one becomes another
possible Ocaml-like language.

*** DONE Hy

Clojure-like in Python

Done by kanaka himself.

*** DONE Skew

http://skew-lang.org/

Done by Dubek.

*** TODO Pony

The new cool kid on the block.  It appears to have a significantly
advanced type system and compiler, as well as support for
capability-based programming and actors.

*** TODO Rebol / Red

A language proposing DSLs as solution to everything with a syntax
reminiscent of Tcl/Forth.

*** TODO Self

Looks like Smalltalk, but goes for prototypical OO.  It inspired Io
(which already got an implementation).

*** TODO eC / Ecere

Like Tcl/Tk, it's mostly interesting due to its graphics support.  The
language itself is reminiscent of C, but has some higher-level
constructs, such as proper module support.  No exceptions or closures
yet.

http://ecere.org/tao.pdf

*** TODO FORTRAN

ORLY?

*** TODO COBOL

YARLY

*** TODO BCPL

C predecessor

*** DONE x86 ASM

Because you just hate yourself and deep down, machine code is untyped...

WIP by https://github.com/bendudson/mal/tree/master/nasm

*** TODO HLA

Slightly better than x86 ASM, still untyped

*** TODO PL/I

RMS likes it!

*** TODO SNOBOL / SPITBOL / snocone

Made for string processing!

*** TODO MUMPS

Got its own series of The Daily WTF posts...

*** TODO ALGOL

Revolutionary programming features, syntax or whatever

http://www.nunan.myzen.co.uk/algol68/pame.pdf
https://jmvdveer.home.xs4all.nl/algol.html

*** TODO MODULA-2/MODULA-3

A more modern Pascal?

*** TODO Pike

I only know that Emacs supports it...

*** TODO Dylan

The other way Lisp could have evolved...

*** TODO Squeak/Newsqueak

Language used on Apple's Newton hardware.

*** TODO J/K/APL/IDL

Yay, array processing.  Somewhat Scheme-inspired.

*** TODO Arc, Newlisp, Femtolisp, TXR

Minimal Lisp dialects that may be different enough from the rest used already.

*** TODO CHICKEN

If Guile and Racket made it, why not CHICKEN, too?

*** TODO Arrowlisp

Purely symbolic Lisp, so no numbers...

*** TODO Felix

http://felix-lang.org/

A powerful inliner compiling procedural/functional ML code to C++

*** TODO Pure

Another functional language, uses term rewriting heavily.

http://purelang.bitbucket.org/

*** TODO ATS

Formal programming, yey.

http://www.ats-lang.org/

*** TODO Oz / Mozart

Looks like forcer got paid writing code in it...

*** TODO Mercury

Real-world Prolog?

*** TODO Icon

"Icon is a very high-level programming language featuring goal
directed execution and many facilities for managing strings and
textual patterns."

*** TODO Myrddin

C with ADTs?

http://eigenstate.org/myrddin/

*** TODO Shadow

...

http://shadow-language.org/

*** TODO SuperCollider

The other alternative to ChucK.  Has first-class functions, feels more
like a scripting language and is mostly undocumented.  Fun.

*** TODO Luck

C meets FP?

https://luck.subarctic.org/

*** TODO L.B. Stanza

Not quite Lisp

http://lbstanza.org/index.html

*** TODO Sidef

Pretty

https://github.com/trizen/sidef

*** TODO potion

So that's what _why has been doing...

https://github.com/perl11/potion/

*** TODO m4

Because TeX isn't insane enough

*** TODO spry

smalltalk and rebol on nim, woo

*** TODO Solidity

https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Programming on the blockchain?  Crazy shit...

*** TODO jq

It might do it, once obstacles like arbitrary IO are sorted out

*** TODO XSLT

Welcome to the Turing tarpit!

*** TODO Eiffel

Contracts?

*** TODO Sather

Like Eiffel, but with Closures and more

*** TODO Standard ML

The language that inspired Ocaml.  Not sure which implementation to
pick, there's Mythril (which might be its own thing...), Moscow ML,
Poly/ML, NJML, etc.

*** TODO Yeti

A ML on the JVM

*** TODO Clay (2011)

https://github.com/jckarter/clay

System programming language with all the high-level constructs one
wants?  Want.

*** TODO Zig

http://ziglang.org/

Another too high-level looking system programming language.  Made by
Mr. libsoundio

*** TODO s-lang

http://www.jedsoft.org/slang/doc/html/slang.html

*** TODO Kernel

vau, vau!

*** TODO None

https://bitbucket.org/duangle/nonelang/src

Used in http://www.duangle.com/nowhere

*** TODO Cobra

http://cobra-language.com/

*** TODO Whiley

http://whiley.org/

*** TODO Pliant

http://www.fullpliant.org/

*** TODO Ceylon, Gosu

Sort of like Groovy as they run on the JVM

*** TODO Boo, Nemerle

CLR languages

*** TODO Vala, Genie

GNOME languages compiling to C using GLib

*** TODO Reason, Bucklescript, Purescript

https://github.com/facebook/reason

Not ready yet, once it documents interop with npm or C...

*** TODO wren, Lox

http://wren.io/
http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/

Supports most you'd need, can be embedded (and extended?)

*** TODO zygomys

https://github.com/glycerine/zygomys

*** TODO Pyret

Most mature Racket language?

*** TODO Zimbu

The other creation of Vim's author

http://www.zimbu.org/Home

*** TODO Varnish/VCL, Asterisk (Dialplan)

Embedded special purpose languages that are implemented and extensible
in C.  The tricky part is figuring out how to speak to their
interpreters from outside as Varnish is part of a web server setup and
Asterisk is a SIP solution.

*** TODO Monkey X

Not to be confused with [[https://interpreterbook.com/][Monkey]].  Looks like a mixture of Basic and
Haxe.

*** TODO Gravity

https://marcobambini.github.io/gravity/

Yet another embedding language.

*** TODO Fantom

Better Java except it targets JVM/CLR/JS

http://fantom.org/

*** TODO Beta

Old OOP language with minimal syntax

http://cs.au.dk/~beta/doc/faq/beta-language-faq.html

*** TODO Processing

I thought this to be impossible, but
https://github.com/zick/ProcessingLisp manages doing it.

*** TODO E

A language clearly ahead of its time.  The only implementation runs on
Java, so interfacing with the outer world should be doable.

http://www.erights.org/download/

*** TODO Ioke

Something Io-inspired, but different.

https://ioke.org/

*** TODO Squirrel

This embedded language is nuts!  Just kidding, it looks simple, has
closures and is dynamic.

http://www.squirrel-lang.org/

*** TODO Oberon

The Oxford Oberon compiler might work

*** TODO Euphoria

Something sequences:

http://www.rapideuphoria.com/

*** TODO Falcon

Allows every programming paradigm!!!

http://www.falconpl.org/

*** TODO Chapel

This shit is cray: http://chapel.cray.com/

*** TODO Joy

A point-free, concatenative language

*** TODO SPL

Scripting language by the STFL author.  Seems to support everything
you'd need, but careful, it's unmaintained!

*** TODO Coldfusion

There's like three open-source implementations of it and it appears
the language has been split into a PHP-like (templates) and JS-like
(business logic) part.  You'll most likely have to look up
documentation on the Adobe website.

- OpenBD
- Railo (dead)
- Lucee (Railo Fork)

There's also https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox

*** TODO Nickle

A not quite calculator language with C-style syntax.

http://nickle.org/

*** TODO Wolfram Alpha / Mathematica

It can be used for non-commercial purposes on a Raspberry Pi, so that
would allow me to develop MAL on one.  The CI thing would probably
violate their license agreement though.

https://github.com/kawabata/wolfram-mode

*** TODO Moonscript

Looks like CoffeeScript, compiles down to Lua

*** TODO Golo

JVM-based weakly typed language with many features from functional programming.

http://golo-lang.org/

*** TODO Flix

JVM-based language looking like Scala and Prolog.  Doesn't look ready yet.

*** TODO Clean

Reminiscent of Haskell

https://clean.cs.ru.nl/Clean

*** TODO Limbo

Part of the Inferno distribution

Looks like a proto-Go to me. It's strongly typed, with a GC,
processes, somewhat C-like syntax, but with hints of Pascal.

The greatest problem is interacting with it.  You can run Inferno in
hosted mode, however the emulator doesn't see the host's files by
default.  You can mount them interactively with =bind -ac '#U*/home'
/usr= or hardcode it in the init files.  If you exit the thing, it
kills itself and its processes.

*** TODO X10

High-performance, parallel, productive(?)

http://x10-lang.org/

*** TODO Urbi/Urbiscript

Like Javascript, but for robotics: http://urbi.jcbaillie.net/doc/

*** TODO Opa

A better JS, powered by ML

*** TODO Ooc

https://ooc-lang.org/

*** TODO Odin

https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin

*** TODO Frege / Eta

JVM Haskell

*** TODO Nu

A Lisp for Mac people.  It may be possible to run on Linux thanks to
GNUStep: https://github.com/nulang/nu/blob/master/ubuntu.sh

*** TODO Lily

Statically typed language with an interpreter

https://github.com/FascinatedBox/lily

*** TODO Terra

For those who found Lua too high-level

https://github.com/zdevito/terra

*** TODO Neko

Not quite low-level language for NekoVM.  Seems to have most things
you'd need, including FFI to measure time accurately and use GNU
Readline.  It's intended as a compilation target (as done by the Haxe
implementation), but it should be possible to write it by hand.

https://nekovm.org/

* Other stuff

A logical continuation to MAL would be building a byte-code
interpreter or simplistic compiler.
